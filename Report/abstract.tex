We investigate the equilibrated flux estimator for finite element solutions. This estimator
provides a constant-free reliability bound and --- more importantly --- yields an efficiency estimate
with a constant independent of the polynomial degree
used in the finite element space. We prove that the adaptive finite element method driven by this estimator provides an optimal convergence rate.
Performance of the equilibrated flux estimator is then numerically compared with other well-established estimators.
